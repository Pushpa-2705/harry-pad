### Why did I make it?
As I dont have a keyboard I work on my laptop's keyboard so I can assign specific keys for specific functions i.e. Opening Spotify, Copy paste shortcuts, Screenshot shortcuts etc.

### What was the hardest part about this ?
The hardest part was probably the firmware as I didnt know any coding language so it was pretty challenging
